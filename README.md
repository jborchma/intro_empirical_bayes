# Introduction to empirical Bayes estimation

This repo holds the Jupyter notebooks for that go along with the excellent book *Introduction to
empirical Bayes* by David Robinson. He used exclusively R in his book but I created some
companion Jupyter notebooks that recreate the most important calculations and plots.

This is aimed to eventually be the foundation of a class/tutorial to teach, but for now it is just my
way to save some of my Python code base.

For suggestions and improvements, don't hesitate to open issues and submit PRs.
